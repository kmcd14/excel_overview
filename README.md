# Using Excel For Data Analysis

- The preparation and cleaning of data.
- Exploring and analysing the processed data.
- Visualisation. 
- Report writing.


## The Request 

<em>The board is asking to see how volume looked in Q2. I got some data (attached), but didn’t have a chance to pull anything together and was hoping you could take a stab at it.

I think they just want to see Q2 2021 volume by region and wanted to know if everything was looking good. I think this file has what you need. I don’t remember all the region codes – I know NAM ends in 1, EMEA ends in 3 and APAC and LATAM are 2 and 4, but I don’t remember which is which. I do know LATAM has the lowest volume so just go ahead and assign that to which ever comes out lowest. </em>
